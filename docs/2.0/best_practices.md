# Tips
Pheniqs is a generic, fast, and accurate sequence demultiplexer, apt to
demultiplex almost every conceivable barcoding strategy in use today.
That said, there are some common conventions we recommend for the best possible
performance, regardless of the barcoding strategy employed. Below are a few tips
that we recommend that we believe are best for your analysis.

## Reduce all read segments into CRAM BEFORE Analysis
[CRAM](glossary.html#htslib) is an efficient format for storing sequencing information.
Since Pheniqs is I/O bound, reading from only one file is significantly faster.

- Automatic input detection
