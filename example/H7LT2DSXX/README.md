# NovaSeq 6000

This is an example folder for processing a dual index paired end run performed by a NovaSeq 6000. The flowcell has 4 lanes each with 4 segments containing 151, 8, 8, and 151 cycles.

**All shell commands mentioned bellow are executed in this folder.**

[core.json](core.json) is a core configuration file that summarizes metadata extracted from the [xml files](illumina/181014_A00534_0024_AH7LT2DSXX). It is imported by most other configuration files in this example. It was created by executing

```
pheniqs-illumina-api.py core illumina/181014_A00534_0024_AH7LT2DSXX
```
